# EngineWebServer - Web API for Rocket Engine Control

EngineWebServer is Liquid Propulsion Groups edge software that is used on a static rocket for engine testing. This Web API is used to control a rocket engine from a safe distance.

Express is used to serve routes and the SerialPort is used to control hardware. The project is written in TypeScript for its strong static typing and less error-prone nature.
